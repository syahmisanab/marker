## 1. Introduction
- Overview of Ainex robot and competition structure
- What students will build and achieve by the end of the day
- Live demo of Sprint and Marathon games

## 2. Network Configuration
- Connecting to Ainex over LAN/Wi-Fi
- Accessing Ainex using **VNC Viewer**
- Troubleshooting connection issues

## 3. Python & ROS Basics
- Basic Python scripting (variables, loops, functions)
- Core ROS concepts: nodes, topics, messages, services
- Using `rostopic`, `rosrun`, and viewing messages

## 4. Docker Basics & Ainex Controller
- Using Docker to launch the Ainex environment
- How to enter and interact with the ROS container
- Introduction to the **Ainex Controller GUI**:
  - Move individual joints
  - Load and play motion groups (like `walk_ready`)
  - Explore joint calibration 

## 5. Gait Control (Sprint ‚Äì Movement)
- Using `GaitManager` to walk forward, reverse, and turn
- Understanding movement parameters (`x`, `y`, `yaw`)
- Stopping gait safely

## 6. Sprint Game (`sprint.py`)
- Full movement loop: walk ‚Üí reverse
- Structure of `sprint.py` code
- Editing duration and speed
- Running the sprint mission

## 7. Line Following (Visual Patrol)
- Explaining line detection using color
- Understanding ROIs and how the camera is processed
- Running and tuning `VisualPatrol` for stability

## 8. Arrow Detection
- Using OpenCV to detect left, right, and forward arrows
- Understanding 7/9-point contour logic
- How detection is published as `/arrow/shape_direction`

## 9. Marathon Game (`marathon.py`)
- Transition logic: line follow ‚Üí arrow detect ‚Üí react
- Handling turns and forward walking
- Testing full mission from start to finish

## üéØ Deliverables

By the end of the day, students should be able to:
- Operate the robot via VNC
- Control gait manually
- Modify and run `sprint.py` and `marathon.py`
- Understand ROS topics used in competition
- Debug and tweak parameters like turn speed and line color
